## **... "what" is "that" ? ...**  
   
----  

#### ... what could possibly be the idea behind being "one" ? ...
... in my "world" ... it's all about wiring "things" (people/groups) to each other ...  

----  
  
#### ... what could those "things" be which are in need to be wired ? ...
... people/groups having "something" getting done ... wired to ...  
... people/groups capable of providing all that "stuff" ...  
... getting all that done what has to be done ...

#### ... *crystal clear* ... everyone might think ...  
... all what these recruiters would have to do is ...  
... listening carefully to what their customers might possibly need ...  
... do some "homework" in case there's something they are unfamiliar with ...  
... and finally ...   
... find that person or group who does fit related to those requirements in question ...

#### ... those of us trying to get employed or hired if you prefer ...  
... nowadays it's merely impossible to get in touch with anybody who isn't some kind of a HR managing instance ...  
... this brings with it that in most cases these HR instances do not understand if one tries to communicate technical stuff ...  
... more often than not they are even not interested in technical stuff at all ... so where's the sense talking to them if that what you bring to the table is of technical nature ...  
... most companys have outsourced this HR seeking process ... for them this might be a clever cost saving idea ...  
... for those like me who need a conversation about technical topics to make their points this situation can be a nightmare ... and often is ...

#### ... those companys trying to get their **_fit_**  
... how many departments get in touch with exactly those *candidate profiles* which in fact could and would if hired solve their pending problems ...  
... how many application files get filtered out to the trash can because layout details are higher importance than potenial profile fit should be ...
