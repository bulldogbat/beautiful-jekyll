## **... "what" is "that" ? ...**  
   
----  

#### ... what could possibly be the idea behind being "one" ? ...
... in my "world" ... it's all about wiring "things" (people/groups) to each other ...  

----  
  
#### ... what could those "things" be which are in need to be wired ? ...
... people/groups having "something" getting done ... wired to ...  
... people/groups capable of providing all that "stuff" ...  
... getting all that done what has to be done ...  
  
----  
  
#### ... *crystal clear* ... everyone might think ...  
... all what these recruiters would have to do is ...  
... listening carefully to what their customers might possibly need ...  
... do some "homework" in case there's something they are unfamiliar with ...  
... and finally ...   
... find that person or group who does fit related to those requirements in question ...  
... that's all there is to it ...  

---  
  
#### ... what's the problem one might ask ? ...  
... my experiences over the course of a couple of years now are ...  
... rarely had these recruiters I have met past couple of years any substantial *clue* about what their customers were in need of ...  
... no **"filling gaps of knowledge homework"** has been done by them in order to get "level" to the requirements in question ...  
... and then we have all these potential "resources" presenting their skillsets on/in all those **self ad portals** getting **webscraped** and **targeted** through mails from those recruiters caused by **crawler app alerts** for merely two keyword findings through these very apps ...  

---  
  
#### ... those of us **_trying to get employed or hired_** if you prefer ...  
... nowadays it's merely impossible to get in touch with anybody else than being some sort of HR managing instance ...  
... this brings with it that in most cases these HR instances do rarely understand if one tries to communicate technical stuff ...  
... more often than not they are even not interested in technical stuff at all ... so where's the sense talking to them if that what you do bring to the table is of technical nature ...  
... most companys outsourced this HR seeking process ... this might be a clever cost saving idea tey think ...  
... but for those like me who need a conversation about technical topics to make their points this situation can be a nightmare ... and often is ...  
  
---  

#### ... those companys trying to get their **_fit_**  
... how many departments get in touch with exactly those *candidate profiles* which in fact could and would if hired solve their pending problems ...  
... how many application files get filtered out to the trash can because layout details are of higher importance than potenial profile fit should be ...

#### ... _who_ is talking to _whom_ ...  
... so how does that work ? ...  
... a recruiter that might or might not be clear about what a specific department is looking for ...  
... is communicating to an HR instance that also might or might not be clear about the requirements ...  
... both possibly absolutly not willing to make that drilldown to get in shape for this technical blah blah ...  
... and ... where do recruiters get their information from ? ... has there been a communication with that specific department which formulated the demand for additional resource ? ... my personal guess is ... NO !!!! ... the information is taken from the companys web site ... and that job ad is formulated by the HR department of that company ... 

---  

#### ... my suspicion is ...  
... an increasing trend of grabbing, sucking and copying job ads from wherever one can grab, suck and copy it ...  
... here in germany is a public job portal ... claiming of having more than 1.700.000 job offerings ...  
... when getting closer ... that's really what can be called ... FAKE ... 
... wild copying ... *recruiters* are copying job ads from *temporary employment agencies* ...  
... as I said it ... everybody sucks everything from everywhere ...  
 
---  

#### ... impossible to get a realistic picture !!!!! ...  
... what I want to say is ...  
... let's say you are an average web user ... trying to find a job ... web based search ...  
... you open your prefered browser ... you hammer in something like ... _jobs_ blah blah ...  
... your browser provides you with tons of _commercial job portals_ you could turn to ...  
... you click into one of those *offerings* ... you find let's say one interesting job ...  
... then ... you head to the next job portal ... you crank through the list ...  
... same job ad as before ... next job portal ... same job ad again ... and so on ...  
... the thing is ... an average user has to do all this searching by ...  
... pointing and clicking ... pointing and clicking ... and so forth ...  

---  

#### ... now these publicly maintained job portals ...  
... they pull all job ads comming from these aforementioned job portals into their own repository ...  
... now you have them all in one place ... x times the same job ad offered from y _recruiters_ ...
... copied as seen from who knows where ... slightly modified in text ... different layout ...  
... I leave the rest up to you ...  

---  

#### ... who the hell has got so much time cranking through all this __crap__ ????? ....  
... **NOT ME** ...  
... **I'm totally fed up by this ... don't know how to name _it_** ...
