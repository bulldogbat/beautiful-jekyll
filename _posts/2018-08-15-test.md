## **... "what" is "that" ? ...**  
   
----  

#### ... what could possibly be the idea behind being "one" ? ...
... in my "world" ... it's all about wiring "things" (people/groups) to each other ...  

----  
  
#### ... what could those "things" be which are in need to be wired ? ...
... people/groups having "something" getting done ... wiring to ...  
... people/groups capable of providing all that "stuff" ...  
... getting all that done what has to be done ...  
  
#### ... *crystal clear* ... everyone might think ...  
... all what these recruiters would have to do is ...  
... listening carefully to what their customers might possibly need ...  
... do some "homework" in case there's something they are unfamiliar with ... and finally ...   
... find that person or group who does fit related to those requirements in question ...  
... that's all there is to it ...  
  
#### ... what is the problem here one might ask ? ...  
... my experiences over the course of a couple of years now are ...  
... rarely did these recruiters I have met past years "understood" substantially what their customers are in need of ...  
... no "filling gaps of knowledge homework" has been done in order to get "level" to the requirements in question ...  
... and all these potential "resources" presenting their skillsets on/in all those countless and evergrowing job portals get webscraped and "targeted" through mails from those recruiters because of "crawler app alerts" for merely two keyword findings of these apps ...
