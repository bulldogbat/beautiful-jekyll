## **... "what" is "that" ? ...**  
   
----  

#### ... what could possibly be the idea behind being "one" ? ...
... in my "world" ... it's about wiring "things" (people/groups) to each other ...  
  
#### ... what could those "things" be which need to be wired ? ...
... people/groups which have "something" getting done ... wired to ...  
... people/groups which are capable of providing all that "stuff" ...  
... getting all that done what has to be done ...  
  
#### ... *crystal clear* ... everyone might think ...  
... all what these recruiters have to do is ... listening carefully to what their customers might possibly need ...  
... do some "homework" in case there's something they are unfamiliar with ... and finally ...   
... find that person or group who does fit related to this requirement in question ...  
  
### ... what is the problem in here ? ...
