### Professional Profile  

##### I would describe myself as a kind of a _data munger_ using _programming skills_ and _creativity_ in order to minimize _nerve wrecking bullshit jobs_. These _data munging skills_ evolved out of an increasing pain I felt over the last couple of decades caused by hammering in data on keyboards with two fingers and this pointing&clicking, copying&pasting and dragging&dropping workflow culture.
